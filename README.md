# WAL-Test Project

I used this repository while learning clean architecture, dagger2, rxjava, liveData and viewModel in kotlin.

I have used github public web services to get a list of users and display it in a Recyclerview 

This project contains one activity and two fragments, One fragment to display a list of users, Second fragment to display a specific user profile.

And last but not least any one have an comment or opinion in this project architecture, you are welcome any time.
